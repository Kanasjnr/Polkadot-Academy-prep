## 📖 Recommended Learning Strategy

1. **Sequential Learning**: Complete exercises in order (intro1 → intro2 → variables1 → ...)
2. **Practice Before Peeking**: Try to solve exercises without looking at solutions
3. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on understanding concepts rather than just passing tests
4. **Take Notes**: Document key concepts and "aha!" moments
5. **Review Regularly**: Revisit earlier topics to reinforce learning

- **Memory Safety**: Avoiding common bugs like null pointer dereferences

These concepts are crucial for substrate development, as they form the foundation for building secure and efficient blockchain applications.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Compilation errors**: Read error messages carefully - Rust's compiler is very helpful
- **Borrow checker**: If you get borrowing errors, review ownership rules
- **Missing semicolons**: Remember Rust's expression vs statement distinction
